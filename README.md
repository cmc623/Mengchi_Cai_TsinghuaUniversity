A brief introduction to Mr.Mengchi Cai's research.

Mr. Mengchi Cai received the B.S. degree in automotive engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2018. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate at School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. His current research interests include:
-> Intelligent and connected cloud control system and its control technology;
-> Task assignment and formation control for multiple vehicles on multi-lane roads;
-> Conflict-free coordinating of vehicles at unsignalized intersections and road networks;
-> Coordinated trajectory planning and tracking for multiple vehicles in complex environment;
-> Onboard safety monitoring for real-time assessment of control inputs through wireless communication.

Mr. Mengchi Cai has published two papers in the field of multi-vehicle coordination, include:
