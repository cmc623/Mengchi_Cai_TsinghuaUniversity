You can follow my research on Researchgate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mengchi-Cai

I received the B.S. and Ph. D. degree in automotive engineering and mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2018 and 2023 respectively. I am currently a post doctoral researcher at School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My current research interests include:

-> Intelligent and connected cloud control system and its control technology;

-> Task assignment and formation control for multiple vehicles on multi-lane roads;

-> Conflict-free coordinating of vehicles at unsignalized intersections and road networks;

-> Coordinated trajectory planning and tracking for multiple vehicles in complex environment;

-> Onboard safety monitoring for real-time assessment of control inputs through wireless communication.
