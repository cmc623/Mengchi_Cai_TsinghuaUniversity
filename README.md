A brief introduction to Mr.Mengchi Cai's research.
Contact me with: cmc18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn

I received the B.S. degree in automotive engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2018. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My current research interests include:

-> Intelligent and connected cloud control system and its control technology;

-> Task assignment and formation control for multiple vehicles on multi-lane roads;

-> Conflict-free coordinating of vehicles at unsignalized intersections and road networks;

-> Coordinated trajectory planning and tracking for multiple vehicles in complex environment;

-> Onboard safety monitoring for real-time assessment of control inputs through wireless communication.

# Publications
I have published several papers in the field of multi-vehicle coordination:
